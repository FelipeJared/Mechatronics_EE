Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win

this will download git installer.

run it.

either will work, just leave it default.

Install, then go to github

here is the github for EE

https://github.com/ryanayoung/Mechatronics_EE

now open the folder where you want this git to be.

mine is just in my Documents.

right click and open git

copy the link and clone to your location

https://github.com/ryanayoung/Mechatronics_EE.git

....this takes a bit.


now you have a local copy.

Now!  when you add something new, i.e. your firmware.

this isn't like google drive.  it won't automatically upload it

once you want to upload something you have to
add it to the queue

you can see the status before hand with git status

.....sorry, you have to open git in the folder that
the repository exists..

it shows you that your local copy has new things compared
to the server copy.

you can add individual files.

git add .

adds everything that's different.

now you have to commit these changes with a message

once it's commited you can push to the server, but you should usually
pull before you push(you can't push if the server is newer
than your local copy.)

now it's uploaded to the server.

everytime you update your code commit it to the
git, then we all can see it, have a copy,
advise, etc.....

Also if someone edit's something and it breaks it, you can revert
back to an earlier commit.




I'm still new at this, so we'll figure it out as we go.

There's also a GUI version rather than commandline, but
I find it's more trouble than it's worth.


idk.  whatever.  please just use it, because a lot of our code is
going to have similar parts, that we should try and keep consistent.

....bye.
